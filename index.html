              <h2>What is Nation of Makers?</h2>
              <p>
                Born of the human desire to create, innovate, and re-imagine the world around us, and fueled by the development of
                low-cost tools, technologies and platforms that allow for more rapid and efficient designing, prototyping and
                fabrication, the maker movement has enabled students and adults alike to bring their ideas to life. The maker
                movement starts with the community; the ecosystem of makers and all that they do and create. More and
                more, we are seeing makers take on challenges both locally and globally, using their knowledge and skills to improve
                their lives and the lives of others in their communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the recent birth of the maker movement, millions of individuals, and thousands of organizations and institutions 
                have found ways to explore their own creative potential. Over the past year along, groups such as The Maker City project 
                (supported by the Kauffman Foundation) have documented how the maker movement is having an impact on communities large 
                and small across the U.S.; more than 1,500 K-12 schools in 50 states have signed on to the Maker Promise, co-led Maker Ed 
                and Digital Promise, and over 77 colleges and universities made public new commitments to creating more opportunities for 
                making on their campuses and in their communities. These are just a few of the recent examples of ways countless organizations
                have been inspired by the hacker and makerspaces and maker events that exist all across this country.
              </p> 
              <p>
                But there is still much work to be done. The maker movement has significant implications for manufacturing, economic and 
                workforce development, education, healthcare innovation, community revitalization, and technology advancements. 
                <strong>To continue to grow the coalition of diverse organizations that are working to support the maker community, this new independent, 
                  non-profit organization called Nation of Makers has been formed. We commit to serving and representing the full variety of spaces, 
                  events, and institutions serving makers, including non-profit organizations, museums, libraries, science centers, educational 
                  institutions, foundations and for-profit companies.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Nation of Makers is working with leaders from the maker community in all 50 states and has received more than 300 Letters of Support 
                from hackerspaces, makerspaces, companies, libraries, local government, and economic development agencies. These Letters of Support 
                both strengthen the organization and share some of the amazing work already being done. We invite you to read some of these stories.

              <h2>Vision</h2>
              <p>
                The vision of Nation of Makers is to build a society where everyone has access to the tools, technologies, experiences
                and knowledge to make anything; to create a thriving, connected, and inclusive community of practice where
                collaboration fosters a culture of abundance.

              <p>
                Below are some <i>examples</i>&nbsp of the initiatives that this organization <i>could</i>&nbsp lead. These activities correspond to key needs
                identified by the maker community and those organizations who are currently supporting the community:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sharing best practices</strong> - Gathering information and best practices from the maker community about starting
                  and sustaining makerspaces and maker events to create a centralized location and resource library where
                  these can be openly accessible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Advocating for the interests of the maker community</strong> â€“ Participating in critical policy development processes
                  impacting the maker community at the federal, state or local level. This can also take shape as key
                  stakeholders across different sectors (government, academia, industry) are convened with the maker
                  community, to identify and collectively develop ways to address key needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Facilitating funding and non-monetary resource opportunities</strong> - Making it easier for maker spaces and other
                  maker organizations to secure funding by identifying existing opportunities, collaborating with funders to
                  develop new grant opportunities, and connecting supporters who may have non-monetary resources to the
                  organizations who need them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Launching a maker fellows program</strong> - Launching a program that aims to place makers with unique skills and
                  experiences within organizations such as federal agencies, companies and research institutions to work on
                  specific projects and inspire a culture of making within organizations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Broadening access and increasing diversity</strong> - Creating and implementing a strategy for 
                  broadening access to making for underrepresented groups and underserved communities.
                </li>

                The <strong>Transition Group</strong> is a collection of community members tasked with the details regarding the formation of the 
                Nation of Makers nonprofit organization. This group has helped to structure and push forward the formation of the Mission, Vision, and Values 
                of the new organization with direct community input. The Transition Group is also laying the framework for the organization including finding the
                initial four <a href='#board'>Board Members</a>, forming the legal entity, organizing community elections for three Board of Directors seats, 
                building a pool of additional qualified candidates willing to serve as board members, and facilitating a call for Executive Director candidates.
              </p>
              <p>
