              <h2>The Transition Group</h2>
              <p>
                The <strong>Transition Group</strong> is a collection of community members tasked with the details regarding the formation of the
                Nation of Makers nonprofit organization. This group has helped to structure and push forward the formation of the Mission, Vision, and Values
                of the new organization with direct community input. The Transition Group is also laying the framework for the organization including finding the
                initial four Board Members, forming the legal entity, organizing community elections for three Board of Directors seats,
                building a pool of additional qualified candidates willing to serve as board members, and facilitating a call for Executive Director candidates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together with many from the maker community, the Transition Group has helped kickstart the Nation of Makers nonprofit.

                      I believe in the culture of abundance that is created when individuals from disparate backgrounds come together to create something awesome. Collaboration is key to innovation!

                      I've always tinkered and have been passionate about building and making since I was a young child in a family owned cabinet shop.  
                      In middle school, I was in the last class able to use the school shop school before it got shut down. 
                      In high school, the shop was closed to students and was only used for the maintenance of the building. 
                      I went to college and got an associates degree in networking and computers. 
                      After I graduated, I heard about what a hackerspace was. I didn’t hesitate to check it out and join. 
                      During the first 3 months, I fell in deep into the culture and ended up running for a board position. 
                      From there, I’ve fought to push the maker movement forward through grass root efforts as well as local government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I’m in this to aid in the movement and for all of the people who weren't/aren’t able learn the these important skills and get their hands dirty.

                        Dorothy Jones-Davis is a co-founder and co-producer of the National Maker Faire, the DC Mini Maker Faire, and the #MakerMap. She is deeply interested in finding ways to create connections between a diversity of makers, leveraging their collective skills to harness solutions for the world’s challenges – grand and small. <br> 
                        Recently, she was an AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow in the Division of Engineering Education and Centers within the National Science Foundation’s
                        (NSF) Directorate for Engineering, where her primary area of interest was in understanding the ways in which perceived educational “disruptions” such as the Maker Movement can be leveraged to improve access to pathways in engineering education and careers for traditionally underrepresented populations.<br>
                        Dorothy has made presentations and served as a panelist on the topic of the Maker Movement at a number of venues, including:

                          </li>
                          </ul>
                        A PhD-level neuroscientist by training, Dorothy currently serves as a Scientific Project Manager for Neuroscience at a local Foundation, where she manages public-private-partnerships and consortia between the Federal government, academia and private industry partners. In her spare time, she enjoys building
                        and making (forts, towers, costumes, headbands, jewelry, circuits, and just about everything else) with her seven-year-old daughter.

                      <p>
                        I like to “make stuff that matters” to me and hopefully 
                        to others. I’ve been making stuff since I was a kid, and all 
                        of my professional career has involved making things. I’m 
                        currently working on things that make cold.
