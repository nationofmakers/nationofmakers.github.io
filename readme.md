# Nation of Makers Website


## Purpose

A website which communicates the mission, vision, and values of the Nation of Makers.


## Contributing

**NOTE: The web team hangs out in #nom_website at https://nation-of-makers.slack.com/ -- please come join us!**

Pick whichever of the following two contribution methods fits your style.  **Whichever method you pick, try to minimize your changes per PR, to make review quicker.  Also try to avoid changing nonfunctional whitespace; ensure your editor is set to not convert spaces to tabs and vice versa, and try not to wrap/unwrap lines.**  A simple PR that visually checks out by eyeballing the HTML diff can be accepted quickly.

If you need any help with any of this, please jump into the &#35;nom_website channel in the NOM slack; we're here to help.

*A side note to git pros: We're working on the master branch during
build mode to simplify the process for contributors.


## Contributing via CLI

   You know the drill.  
   
   If you don't know or don't want to mess with all that, then see the
   next section.
   
   If you do want to learn how to use git and github via the CLI, then
   go to [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
