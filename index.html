              <h2>What is Nation of Makers?</h2>
              <p>
                Born of the human desire to create, innovate, and re-imagine the world around us, and fueled by the development of
                low-cost tools, technologies and platforms that allow for more rapid and efficient designing, prototyping and
                fabrication, the maker movement has enabled students and adults alike to bring their ideas to life. The maker
                movement starts with the community; the ecosystem of makers and all that they do and create. More and
                more, we are seeing makers take on challenges both locally and globally, using their knowledge and skills to improve
                their lives and the lives of others in their communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2014, President Obama hosted the White House Maker Faire and launched the Nation of Makers initiative, focused
                on supporting the maker movement; creating more opportunities for students to participate in maker-focused
                learning experiences, facilitating entrepreneurship, and supporting initiatives in local and advanced manufacturing
                that make it easier for makers to scale production.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, a large number of individuals, organizations and institutions have responded to President Obama’s call to
                action. The Maker City project, supported by the Kauffman Foundation, documents how the maker movement is
                having an impact on communities large and small across the U.S. More than 100 local government leaders have
                participated in the Mayor’s Maker Challenge since it launched. More than 1,400 K-12 schools in 50 states have signed
                on to the Maker Promise, co-led by Digital Promise and Maker Ed. 150 colleges and universities wrote letters to
                President Obama describing their commitment to creating more opportunities for making on their campuses and in
                their communities. This eventually led to the creation of the Make Schools Alliance. Similarly, more than 130 libraries
                from around the country articulated their commitment to creating more makerspaces with help from the Urban
                Libraries Council.
              </p>
              <p>
                But there is still much work to be done. The maker movement has significant implications for education,
                economic and workforce development, manufacturing, healthcare innovation, community revitalization and social
                justice. <strong>To build upon the efforts of President Obama’s Nation of Makers initiative, and to continue
                to grow the coalition of diverse organizations that are working to support the maker community,
                an independent, non-profit organization called Nation of Makers is being formed. The organization
                will serve and work with three main groups: makerspace organizers, maker event organizers and maker institutions
                (includes non-profit organizations, foundations, museums, libraries, schools and companies that support makers).</strong>

              <h2>Mission</h2>
              <p>We support the full range of organizations that impact makers by encouraging connections, broadly sharing resources, facilitating funding opportunities, engaging in policy development, and advocating for the maker movement. We help maker organizations amplify the passion, innovation, creativity, and diversity of the maker community, and maximize both local and global impact.</p>

              <h2>Vision</h2>
              <p>
                The vision of Nation of Makers is to build a society where everyone has access to the tools, technologies, experiences
                and knowledge to make anything; to create a thriving, connected, and inclusive community of practice where
                collaboration fosters a culture of abundance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below are some examples of the initiatives that this organization could lead. These activities correspond to key needs
                identified by the maker community and those organizations who are currently supporting the community:

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Broadening access and increasing diversity</strong> - Creating and implementing a strategy for 
                  broadening access to Making for underrepresented groups and underserved communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Facilitating funding and non-monetary resource opportunities</strong> - Making it easier for maker spaces and other
                  maker organizations to secure funding by identifying existing opportunities, collaborating with funders to
                  develop new grant opportunities, and connecting supporters who may have non-monetary resources to the
                  organizations who need them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Launching a maker fellows program</strong> - Launching a program that aims to place makers with unique skills and
                  experiences within organizations such as federal agencies, companies and research institutions to work on
                  specific projects and inspire a culture of making within organizations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sharing best practices</strong> - Gathering information and best practices from the maker community about starting
                  and sustaining makerspaces and maker events to create a centralized location and resource library where
                  these can be openly accessible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Advocating for the interests of the maker community</strong> – Participating in critical policy development processes
                  impacting the maker community at the federal, state or local level. This can also take shape as key
                  stakeholders across different sectors (government, academia, industry) are convened with the maker
                  community, to identify and collectively develop ways to address key needs.

              <h2>The Tranistion Group</h2>
              <p>
                The <strong>Transition Group</strong> is a collection of community members tasked with the details regarding the formation of the Nation of Makers nonprofit organization. This team has helped to structure and push forward the formation of the Mission, Vision, and Values of the new organization with direct community input. The Transition Group has also laid the groundwork for the organization including finding the inital three Board Members, forming the legal entity, putting out a call for Executive
                Director roles and a lot more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together with the original Nation of Makers White House community, the State Ambassadors and other early contributors, the Transition Team has helped kickstart the Nation of Makers nonprofit. Below is an (alphabetical) list of the volunteer Tranistion Group members.
